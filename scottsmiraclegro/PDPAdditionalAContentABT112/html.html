		<h4>When To Apply</h4>
		<p>
		<strong>Apply when weeds are actively growing and daytime temperatures are between 60&#176;F	and 90&#176;F.</strong> In the northern US, weeds are most active April-September. In the southern US, weeds are most active March-September. If you have recently applied another fertilizer (e.g. Scotts&reg; Turf Builder&reg; Lawn Food or Scotts&reg; Turf Builder&reg; Halts&reg; Crabgrass Preventer with Lawn Food) wait at least 30 days to apply Scotts&reg; Turf Builder&reg; Weed & Feed.

		<h4>How To Use</h4>
		<p>
		<strong>1) Check the Weather:</strong> If rain is in the forecast in the next 24 hours, apply another day. Rain can wash the particles off of the weed leaves before it has a chance to work properly.</br>
		<strong>2) Fill and Set Spreader:</strong> Applying Scotts&reg; Turf Builder &reg; Weed & Feed requires a lawn spreader. If you need a new spreader, you can find one here. Refer to the Spreader Settings section above to set your spreader properly.</br>

		<strong>3) Apply to Wet Lawn:</strong> Make sure the grass is wet from dew or sprinkling before applying. This helps particles adhere to weed leaves to produce best results. For even application walk at a steady pace slightly overlapping each pass. After applying this product you don't water your lawn for at least 24 hours. Just like rain, watering your lawn after applying Weed & Feed washes the weed control particles off the weed leaves before they can fully work.</br>

		<strong>4) Clean-Up:</strong> Sweep product from hard surfaces onto the lawn to keep valuable feeding nutrients on the grass and out of storm drains.
